# CAPTURE THE FLAME - GIT GOOD

## Challenge Description
```
With the rise of AI our company had to adapt so we ended up enforcing AI into our engineers' workflow. Not everyone liked it and some of our senior engineers even said "You're going to regret this, you're going to get a bunch of engineers vibe coding!". Anywho they'll catch the "vibe" soon, but oh yeah on an unrelated note one of our api keys has seen some crazy usage recently so we ended up rotating it.
